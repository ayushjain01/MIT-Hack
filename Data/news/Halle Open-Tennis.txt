Daniil Medvedev continued building momentum after recent setbacks as he moved into the quarterfinals of the Halle Open, beating Laslo Djere 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3 at the grass-court tournament. 
Medvedev could have wrapped up the second-round match in straight sets when he took a 4-1 lead in the second-set tiebreaker but lost the next four points as Djere took control. 
Medvedev is coming off first-round losses at the French Open and last week at the Libema Open, his first grass event of the season. The third-ranked Russian is preparing to return to Wimbledon next month for the first time since 2021 after the grass-court Grand Slam barred players from Russia and Belarus last year over the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
